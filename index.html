        <p>My name is Nolwazi Zulu, and I am a 23-year-old first-year application development student at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology.
		My career in IT began when I studied Computer Applications Technology as a subject from 2017 until 2019. 
		I have created a few websites since my IT career began. The more I learn and grow, the more skills I acquire. 
		I have skills in HTML, Java, Python, C, and CSS. Enjoy my work below!</p>

            <h3>知的 /Chi-teki (RFID Card Reader)</h3>
            <p>In response to the growing need for environmental sustainability, I developed a dual-system RFID card reader using C and Python. 
			This innovative solution helps manage chaos within shuttles and enhances user safety.</p>

            <h3>Empowerlink: Keeping Our Cities Cleaner and Greener(NGO)</h3>
            <p>In a rapidly changing world that often neglects environmental health, pollution continues to rise. 
			Empowerlink is an NGO dedicated to reducing pollution and keeping our streets tidy.

            <h3>Venue Booking Website</h3>
            <p>The festive season brings numerous fun events and activities, many of which require suitable venues. 
			However, many event management businesses struggle to effectively track their available spaces. 
			This website allows users to select their desired venue and enter their card details for booking. 
			Users can browse venue images and view seating capacities, streamlining the event planning process. 
			I used HTML and CSS for this website.</p>
